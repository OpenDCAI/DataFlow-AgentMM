# DataFlow-AgentMM showcases

These are GitHub-native walkthroughs of real multimodal trajectories. Each page
contains the natural task prompt, a fading GIF of the complete visual trajectory,
every tool action inside a folded section, the final answer, Judge results, and
ReplayVerify status. Every rendered observation is also preserved at its original
exported resolution inside the corresponding tool-call section. Compact JSON is
provided separately without system prompts, credentials, local workspace paths,
or embedded base64 images.

> **Refine comparisons are never shown as final-only results.** Every page marked
> as refined opens with an explicit notice and includes the complete original
> trajectory, its Judge/ReplayVerify diagnosis, and the complete refined
> trajectory. Refine creates a new rollout and does not overwrite the original.

For before/after comparisons, the original and refined rollouts have separate
full-trajectory animations. The PowerPoint case is an Original-only success:
its 70-step rollout scored 0.9643 against the task-owned rubric, passed the 0.75
gate directly, and did not enter Refine.

## Walkthroughs

| # | Capability | Trajectory coverage | Evaluation |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Image-grounded olympiad geometry](01_geometry_proof.md) | 12-step progressive construction and proof | ReplayVerify passed · Judge 1.00 |
| 2 | [Visual planning in a Pyxel game](02_pixel_game.md) | five gems and goal within a 40-move budget | ReplayVerify passed · Judge 0.85 |
| 3 | [Editable PowerPoint reconstruction](03_pptx.md) | original 70 actions; no Refine | task-owned rubric Judge 0.9643 ≥ 0.75 |
| 4 | [Document pages to an editable diagram](04_diagram.md) | last Refine pass: 38-action input → 45-action result | archived Judge 0.75 → 0.95 |
| 5 | [Weekly alarms on Android](05_mobile_weekly_alarms.md) | original 80 actions; `finish`; 60 image observations | K2.6 Judge 1.00 · ReplayVerify `not_applicable` |
| 6 | [Activity-day planning in a browser](06_playwright_studio_day.md) | original 15 actions; `finish`; 7 image observations | K2.6 Judge 1.00 · ReplayVerify `not_applicable` |
| 7 | [Low-poly island lighthouse in Blender](07_blender_lighthouse.md) | original 64 actions; `max_steps`, no `finish`; 63 image observations | K2.6 Judge 0.9375 · ReplayVerify `not_applicable` |
| 8 | [Reading 2048 from pixels (G1 VLM-Gym)](08_vlmgym_2048.md) | original 44 moves; `finish`; fresh board to a 64 tile | ReplayVerify passed · Judge 1.00 |
| 9 | [Shisen-Sho path planning on a 12x12 board](09_vlmgym_shisensho.md) | original 10 matches; `environment_final` | ReplayVerify passed · Judge 1.00 |
| 10 | [Clearing a CIFAR-10 Shisen-Sho board](10_vlmgym_shisensho_cifar10.md) | original 20 matches (2 invalid); board cleared | ReplayVerify passed · Judge 0.9375 |
| 11 | [Match-3 swaps with cascades](11_vlmgym_swap.md) | original 24 swaps, no rejections; `finish` at 186 points | ReplayVerify passed · Judge 1.00 |
| 12 | [Why a deterministic verifier is necessary](12_why_deterministic_verifier.md) | original 8 actions → refined 4 actions, both replayed | Judge 0.30 → 1.00; verifier still failed |

The PPT and diagram cases are open-ended authoring tasks. Their
ReplayVerify status is `not_applicable`; this is intentional rather than a
missing implementation. Geometry and game tasks have meaningful exact state
contracts and therefore use deterministic replay verification.

The Android, browser, and Blender cases are original-only Kimi K3 rollouts,
scored separately by Kimi K2.6 against their unchanged task-owned rubrics. No
Refine or deterministic verifier was used for these three selected runs. Here,
`not_applicable` means no verifier was bound, not that exact checks would be
impossible for alarms or a saved schedule. Blender reached its 64-step cap and
has no final answer; the high Judge score does not turn that into a finished
rollout or a formal render. The browser task used a local fixture, and Android
used an empty, dedicated emulator that was restored after evidence capture.

The four VLM-Gym cases (08–11) are original-only `gemini-3.8-flash` rollouts of
the hardest checked-in task per game from `envs/vlmgym`, which reproduces G1's
VLM-Gym rules and frames. Each passed deterministic ReplayVerify against the
task's state predicate and was then scored by `AgentMMTrajectoryQualityEvaluator`
with `gemini-3.8-flash` as Judge and the generic four-criterion rubric (these
tasks define no `judge_ref`); no Refine was run. The Swap case was re-rolled
after its status line was changed to show the live score, moves left, and
shuffle count instead of upstream's constant text. The 12x12 Shisen-Sho board
has no connectable pair left after its tenth match, which ends the episode with
`environment_final`.

The diagram example shows the final v23 Refine pass, including its actual input
trajectory (itself a previous refinement). Its historical, model-reported Judge
scores predate the current task-owned normalized-mean protocol and are not
directly comparable to the new PPTX score. Manual polishing is not included.

## Output artifacts

- [Editable PowerPoint deck](assets/outputs/northstar_board_update.pptx)
- [Editable Draw.io source](assets/outputs/lighthouse_incident_response.drawio)
- [Incident-flow PNG](assets/outputs/lighthouse_incident_response.png)
- [Final geometry construction](assets/outputs/geometry_tangent_theorem.png)

The reference deck and runbook pages are original repository fixtures; these
showcases do not redistribute a third-party presentation or document.

## Format

Markdown is the published representation because GitHub renders it directly.
The source pipeline still stores canonical JSONL trajectories with full image
content. `export_showcases.py` converts selected rows into:

```text
showcases/
├── 01_...md ... 12_...md     # human-readable walkthroughs; verifier remains last
├── assets/                    # referenced PNGs and editable outputs
└── trajectories/              # compact, machine-readable JSON
```

The exporter writes every rendered observation once as a source PNG, embeds it
under the matching tool call, and builds a smaller 64-color GIF overview from the
same complete sequence. Compact trajectory JSON links every step to its exported
images through `observation_images`. Refined cases use a paired JSON document with
separate `original` and `refined` records.

The four VLM-Gym pages were rendered with this exporter's `render_case` from
replay-verified, judged rollout rows. The three MCP showcase additions were prepared with an external export script;
no new GIF-generation code or application dependency was added to the package.
Their compact JSON includes recorded model names, termination status, per-step
errors, the exact normalized Judge score, and source digests. Host-local path
prefixes are replaced with `<LOCAL_DF>/`; actions, task text, and observation
images are otherwise preserved. These compact records are publication views,
not substitutes for canonical, replay-ready trajectories. Only the explicit
action `thought` field is shown as reasoning; provider-private reasoning is not
published.
