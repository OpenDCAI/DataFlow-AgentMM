**Run multimodal agents in visual environments and get every run back as a
structured, replayable `Trajectory`.**

- **Watch agents act on pixels** — a task, an Env, and one tool loop; every
  action and rendered observation is recorded.
- **Synthesize trajectory data** — generate at scale, then verify, judge,
  repair, and select trajectories for downstream use.
- **Trust what you keep** — deterministic replay in a fresh Env answers whether
  the recorded actions really produce the final state.

Python package: `dataflow_agentmm`. Text and image are the canonical content
types today; the contracts leave room for more modalities without making every
Env stateful.

## 🚀 Quickstart

With Python 3.10+ and Git available, install the package and its Python dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install \
  "git+https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-MM.git@155253460f6f2e50705a3e779f259b382a382822" \
  "git+https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent.git@mm-agent"
python -m pip check
```

Next, configure an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint and register an Env.
Continue with [From installation to your first trajectory](QUICKSTART.md)
for environment setup, your first rollout, trajectory inspection, and export.

<a name="framework-design"></a>

## 🧩 Framework design

DataFlow-AgentMM connects environment interaction, trajectory recording, and
data processing through shared contracts. This lets new Envs reuse the same
rollout and evaluation components.

- **Lightweight environment integration.** An Env exposes its tools through
  `tools()` and executes them through `call()`, with optional `start()` and
  `close()` hooks. Integration code and application dependencies live in
  separate Env packs, which can run in their own Python processes.
- **Structured multimodal trajectories.** A `Trajectory` records model messages,
  actions, and observations, with text and images as explicit content blocks.
  The same record supports visualization, action replay in a fresh Env, and
  conversion to ms-swift format.
- **Separate verification and quality evaluation.** ReplayVerify replays actions
  and checks the task's deterministic conditions; Judge evaluates the recorded
  evidence against a rubric and provides repair suggestions. Their results
  remain separate so pipelines can use the checks appropriate to each task.
- **Composable data processing.** Generation, search, verification, judging,
  refinement, selection, and export are independent operators or utilities.
  Pipelines can combine them as needed; Refine produces a new trajectory while
  preserving the original attempt for comparison.

## 🔄 Trajectory pipeline

A `Task` names an Env and carries the messages the model sees. `AgentRollout`
creates a fresh Env, runs one tool loop, and records every action and
observation as a `Trajectory`. Operators then compose around that record:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/pipeline.png" alt="Any Env plugs into tools() + call(), any model into ModelServing, and the operators snap together around the recorded Trajectory" width="100%"></p>

| Stage | Operator | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate | `AgentMMExploreGenerator` | Runs the tool loop and records unscored trajectories; resumable per sample. |
| Search | `AgentMMExploreTreeGenerator` | Branches several actions per node, each child replayed from a fresh Env. |
| ReplayVerify | `AgentMMReplayVerifier` | Replays stored actions in a fresh Env and runs the task's deterministic verifier. |
| Judge | `AgentMMTrajectoryQualityEvaluator` | Scores the task rubric from the real observations and reports which steps failed. |
| Refine | `AgentMMTrajectoryRefiner` | Re-explores with the verifier findings, the reviewer suggestion, and the flagged steps. |
| Select | `AgentMMTrajectorySelector` | Keeps trajectories meeting declarative quality conditions, then ranks, de-duplicates, and caps them. |
| Export | `dataflow_agentmm.export` | Converts trajectories to ms-swift `messages` JSONL format. |

Judge and ReplayVerify answer different questions: one reviews the process, the
other reproduces the actions and checks exact state. Open-ended authoring tasks
report `not_applicable` for replay rather than pretending to have a verifier.

<a name="lightweight-env-design"></a>

## 🪶 Lightweight Env design

An Env is a tool catalog plus a dispatcher. That is the complete mandatory
surface:

```python
def tools(self) -> Sequence[ToolSpec]: ...
def call(self, tool_name: str, args: Mapping[str, Any]) -> ToolResult: ...
```

```python
class EchoEnv:
    def tools(self):
        return (ToolSpec(
            name="echo",
            description="Echo one string.",
            operation_type="query",
            input_schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"text": {"type": "string"}},
                          "required": ["text"], "additionalProperties": False},
        ),)

    def call(self, tool_name, args):
        if tool_name != "echo":
            return ToolResult.failure("unknown_tool", tool_name)
        return ToolResult.success((TextContent(args["text"]),))


register_env("echo", EchoEnv, description="A stateless echo service.", modalities=("text",))
```

Stateful Envs may additionally expose `start(init, workspace)` and `close()`.
They never implement a task provider, Scenario, snapshot, or verifier, and the
runner supplies `finish` itself. Rollout and replay share one startup order:

```text
create Env -> optional start(init, workspace) -> tools() -> tool loop -> close()
```

An MCP server attaches through the same surface: map `list_tools()` to
`ToolSpec`, map `call_tool()` to `ToolResult`, and register the adapter factory.
A session-based server connects in `start()`, discovers its catalog through that
session, and releases it in `close()`; the MCP SDK stays in the Env package.

The bundled [`create-env` workspace skill](dataflow_agentmm/skills/create-env/SKILL.md)
documents catalog discovery, lifecycle rules, the adapter workflow, and the
validation gates in full.

## 📐 Core contracts

```text
Task ──> AgentRollout ──> Trajectory
 │           │
 │           └── fresh Env selected by task.env_id
 │
 └── optional Scenario(init)

Trajectory + TaskResolver + optional VerifierResolver
                              └──> ReplayVerify ──> ReplayVerification
```

- A runner always receives a `Task`; a Task and its trajectories have a
  one-to-many relationship.
- `Scenario` exists only when private initialization data must enter a fresh Env.
- The registry owns Env factories and solver-facing metadata, not tasks.
- Verification is resolved independently and never forces a Scenario.
- `Trajectory` contains actions and observations, not a verifier score or
  private Scenario data.

Concrete Envs are outside the core distribution so installing one integration
does not force every rendering or game dependency into `dataflow-agentmm`.
An integration may use the package's process proxy when it needs a dedicated
interpreter or dependency boundary.

<a name="scope"></a>

## 🎯 Scope

- Text and image are the canonical content types today; audio and video are not
  part of the contracts yet.
- This package ships the runtime, operators, and contracts. Concrete Envs, their
  dependencies, and their tasks live in separate Env packs.
- Deterministic replay requires an Env whose actions reproduce the same state;
  Envs backed by unseeded randomness or external live services cannot be
  verified this way.
- Process isolation is optional: use it when an Env needs its own interpreter or
  dependency boundary.
